    "body": "Great piece of software!\r\n\r\nOn the off-chance that the issue is with me and not CSVKit, I have opened a question on StackOverflow also:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26205666/how-to-load-international-data-into-mysql-using-csvkit\r\n\r\nHas anyone seen the following issue?\r\n\r\nI am loading a a pipe-delimited file of hotels into MySQL using CSVKit (https://csvkit.readthedocs.org/en/0.9.0/index.html).\r\n\r\nSome of the hotel name fields contain \"non-English\" characters ( e.g. \"Ånedin Hostel\").  I have noticed that the character \"Å\" in particular tends to confuse \"csvsql\" regarding the pipe delimiter (\"|\"), causing both the record that contains the \"non-English\" character--and also the \"next\" record in the delimited file--to fail to load the fields correctly (both NULLs loaded and \"fields offset\" occur; the \"Å\" character is ommitted entirely).\r\n\r\nThe original fa\r\niled configuration was discovered using the following:\r\n\r\nMySQL Schema Character Set:  \"DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci\"\r\ncsvsql Command: csvsql --blanks -d \"|\" -e \"iso-8859-1\" --db mysql://root:pwd@localhost:3306/schema_name --table table_name --insert CSVFileName.csv \r\n\r\nOkay, I now know that \"\"iso-8859-1\"\" is the same thing as \"latin1_swedish_ci\" in MySQL and that  _might_ explain the original failure...however, I cannot find the encoding parameter to pass to \"csvsql\" that will cause it to load \"UTF-8\".  I have tried every variant of \"utf-8\" that would seem appropriate, thus:\r\n\r\ncsvsql Command: csvsql --blanks -d \"|\" -e \"UTF-8\" --db mysql://root:pwd@localhost:3306/schema_name --table table_name --insert CSVFileName.csv \r\n\r\n--or--\r\n\r\ncsvsql Command: csvsql --blanks -d \"|\" -e \"utf-8\" --db mysql://root:pwd@localhost:3306/schema_name --table table_name --insert CSVFileName.csv \r\n\r\n--or--\r\n\r\ncsvsql Command: csvsql --blanks -d \"|\" -e \"utf8\" --db mysql://root:pwd@localhost:3306/schema_name --table table_name --insert CSVFileName.csv \r\n\r\nI have alos tried different MySQL Schema character sets, particularly:\r\n\r\n*  \"DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci\"\r\n*  \"DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci\"\r\n*  \"DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4\"\r\n*  \"DEFAULT COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci\"  (see \"https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/mysql-utf8mb4\")\r\n\r\nAttempting the last two configs generates an interesting error:  \"OperationalError) (1118, 'Row size too large. The maximum row size for the used table type, not counting BLOBs, is 65535. You have to change some columns to TEXT or BLOBs')\", from:\r\n\r\nMySQL Schema Character Set:  \"DEFAULT COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci\"\r\ncsvsql Command: csvsql --blanks -d \"|\" -e \"utf8\" --db mysql://root:pwd@localhost:3306/schema_name --table table_name --insert CSVFileName.csv \r\n\r\n\r\nI suspec that the issue lies with the encoding parameter in \"csvsql\", but I could be wrong.  It might be combination of the encoding and the schema character set...\r\n\r\nThe question is:  What is that parameter? or what is the combination of the parameter with the character set for international data?\r\n\r\nCSVKit uses SQLAclchemy (http://www.sqlalchemy.org/).  According to the SQLAlchemy docs you would expect the parameter to be \"utf8\" (http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/dialects/mysql.html), but as mentioned, that does not seem to work (see above).\r\n\r\nOne other bit of sleuthing:  According to the CSVKit docs \"Python 3’s csv module supports unicode internally\".  My Ubuntu machine's default Python version is \"Python 2.7.6\".  I do, however, have the latest Python 3.x installed and up-to-date, so one would think that CSVKit would use that (if available), right?  If not, how would I I make CSVKit use Python 3?\r\n\r\nAny ideas or suggested best-practices for loading international data would be appreciated.  (I am asking for guidance on the best set of default schema settings to use with MySqL for a varied set of international data.  In effect, what is the most \"future proof\" way to build all MySQL schemas?)\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nShameless\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "It would be helpful to have the option to add a prefix to the column names output by `csvjoin` for easy disambiguation between similarly named columns. For example, I might have two CSV files `a.csv` and `b.csv` which both have a column `foo`. It would be nice to be able to do:\r\n\r\n    csvjoin --columns bar,bar --prefix a,b a.csv b.csv > c.csv\r\n\r\nAnd then get the header `a_foo,a_bar,b_foo,b_bar`. This is especially useful when you have to do further processing on the file. It's meach easier to prepend a string to the column name instead of keeping track of indices. If this is something you're open to, I could work on a PR as I don't imagine it will take a lot of work."
