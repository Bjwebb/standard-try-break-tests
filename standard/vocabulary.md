## Vocabulary

The world of procurement and contacting has many specialist terms. However, the precise way that these terms are used can vary from sector to sector, and country to country. Below we define how we are using a number of key terms. 

    
-   **Contract** - the specific document that is finally signed between the buyer (a public entity) and supplier.

-   **Contracting** - the entire process of public contracting including the
    planning, formation, award, execution, performance, completion, and
    evaluation of a contract. Contracting includes the variety of contract types from more basic contracts
    for procurement of goods to complex contracts, joint venture agreements, licenses and production sharing agreements. Other terms that may be used for this process are public procurement, public tendering. 

-   **Contracting Process** - is the sequence of events related to the lifespan of 
    a contract, beginning with planning and culminating in contract closure. It is contested whether this is a chain or in fact a cycle, as the results reported throughout the process should be used to inform subsequent contracting practices.[^1] In addition, in the data standard, we define a unique contracting process as one with a unique procurement process (see standard for more details).

-   **Open Contracting** - norms and practices for increased disclosure and participation in public contracting. 
    It covers the entire contracting process. Open contracting encompasses all public contracting, including contracts
    funded by combinations of public, private and donor sources.

-   **Notice** - a document providing information about a specific stage of the contracting process. For example, a tender 
    notice or an award notice. 

-   **Release** - the publication of information about any aspect of contracting. Often in the form of a notice, but 
    also including other supplementary releases of information. 

-   **Tender** - Typically, the process on inviting suppliers to submit bids for evaluation and selecting a winner or winners.
     Types of tendering include: open competitive bidding, direct / sole-source, shopping / three quotations, inverse auctions, 
     framework contracts and more complex methodologies. We use the term broadly to mean the process that occurs between 
     deciding a procurement is necessary and awarding a contract, a process that should be documented.

-   **Termination** - the ending of a contract, either because the contracted activity is complete, or because of some other 
     reason (e.g. breach of contract terms).
