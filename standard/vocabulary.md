## Vocabulary

The world of procurement and contacting has many specialist terms. However, the precise way that these terms are used can vary from sector to sector, and country to country. Below we define how we are using a number of key terms. 

    
-   **Contract** - the specific document that is finally signed between the buyer (a public entity) and supplier.

-   **Contracting** - the entire process of public contracting including the
    planning, formation, award, execution, performance, completion, and
    evaluation of a contract. Contracting includes the variety of contract types from more basic contracts
    for procurement of goods to complex contracts, joint venture agreements, licenses and production sharing agreements. Other terms that may be used for this process are public procurement, public tendering. 

-   **Contracting Process** - is the sequence of events related to the lifespan of 
    a contract, beginning with planning and culminating in contract closure. It is contested whether this is a chain or in fact a cycle, as the results reported throughout the process should be used to inform subsequent contracting practices.[^1] See below for a detailed description of the phases of the contracting process. In addition, in the data standard, we define a unique contracting process as one with a unique procurement process (see standard for more details).

-   **Formation** - In procurement this is generally known as tendering: the process on inviting suppliers to submit bids for evaluation and selecting a winner or winners. Other types of formation include: open competitive bidding, direct / sole-source, shopping / three quotations, inverse auctions, and framework contracts. The process may only involve a negotiation between the public entity and the private entities, there may be no public or competitive element to it.


-   **Open Contracting** - norms and practices for increased disclosure and participation in public contracting. 
    It covers the entire contracting process. Open contracting encompasses all public contracting, including contracts
    funded by combinations of public, private and donor sources.

-   **Notice** - a document providing information about a specific stage of the contracting process. For example, a tender 
    notice or an award notice. 

-   **Release** - the publication of information about any aspect of contracting. Often in the form of a notice, but 
    also including other supplementary releases of information. 

-   **Termination** - the ending of a contract, either because the contracted activity is complete, or because of some other reason (e.g. breach of contract terms).

## The Contracting Process

Excerpt from *Open Contracting - A guide for practitioners by practitioners* as background for the diagram documenting the Contracting Process. 


### Planning
The planning stage must ensure that the contract is in line with the government's action plan and with the mission of the public entity that will oversee it. In the planning stage, the need must be identified and narrowed down, along with the associated risks. The need assesment phase must include consultation with key beneficiaries, also looking at what has worked in the past and inefficiencies of previous contracts. The budget must be allocated. Documents such as annual procurement plans and annual budgets are mandatory in several countries and mark the beginning of the planning stage. Citizens can review different documents associated with the planning stage. They should also advocate for consulations so that decisions are made on the basis of needs effectively expressed by potential beneficiaries and the have a say on the options available.

Several countries have developed provisions in their laws to establilsh the role of citizens in the planning stage. For instance, infrastructure and extraction projects in many Latin American countries must be subject to hearings and agreements with the indigenous communities that will be affected by these projects. Failure to reach an agreement means cancelling or at least modifying the contract to deal with the issues raised during the hearings. This community consultation process should be advocated by any community in the world, as it implies the exercise of the right to information and free and informed consent as established by the International Labour Organisation Convention 169 and the UN Declaraion of the Rights of Indigenous People. 

In the specific case of a Public-Private Partnership (PPP), not only should the purpose of the project be assessed, but the citizen should alsask why the government is engaging in PPP rather than in a public work. There are certain characteristics that make this type of contract preferable in certain situations, where risks can be shared between public and private parties involved. These contracts usually have longer timeframes and larger budget dimensions, which makes them an important consideration of open contracting.

### Tendering
Once the contract has been planned, the entity is ready to open the tendering process. This is usually done by inviting interested suppliers to submit bids that will be evaluated according to specific procedures and evaluation critera set in the bidding documents. In general, citizens should be allowed to comment on the requirements and procedures before the bids are submitted. Once the "winner" is chosen and before the contract is signed, the losing bidders should be alowed to file complaints if they find that the process has not properly followed the established rules. This means that the public entities should have transparent grievance redress mechanisms. Citizens also have a key role once the evaluation decision is announced and can ask for detailed explanations.

What are the different types of tendering? In some cases, public contracting follows a direct contracting scheme, such as when only one company has the specific expertise for the work, or when urgency does not allow for the complete open tendering process. Nonetheless, the reasons for such a decision should be clearly justified in writing.

Beyon direct contracting there are several modes of tendering from shopping (known as three quotations method), open competitive bidding, inverse auctions, framework contracts to more complex contractual arrangements as public-private partnerships, licenses and concessions.

### Contract Execution
After the contract is awarded, the contract is signed, and the necessary guarantees are in place, the execution of the contract starts. During the execution stage, the contractor must comply with the legal requirements as well as with what was stated in the contract. The public entity is accountable for ensuring that the contract is being executed in a proper and timely manner and in compliance with what was agreed, particularly regarding payments. In case of any contract variations, the public entity should notify the relevany authority as well as keep a record of the variations and the justifications.

At this stage, proper contract management procedures must be in place and citizens should ask whether ther milestones -- regarding costs and times -- are being met. Are the parties meeting the commitments that were put in the contract? If there are amendments, why are they happening? Are they justified? Quality of deliverables is also a key factor to be evaluated at several points throughout the contract execution stage.

### Closing
The contract must be closed once the obligations have been fulfiled. Nevertheless, it is important to state that it is possible for contract obligations to exceed the contract term. For example, guarantees may be enforced even after the last payment has ocurred. For instance, if a road is built and paid for, but is ruined several months later - well within the warranty period - both procuring entities and citizens should exert effort in taking the contractor into account. 

Likewise, post-consumption obligaions may be present, such as disposal schemes for polluting materials in the case of oil, gas and mining deals. The contract should answer the questions: Is the contractor obliged to pick up the polluting packaging? Was the community affected as a result of the contracts completion? What was the impact of the project or procurement and was it consustent with what was planned? Answers to questions like these can drive positive changes, making a contractor assume responsibility and establishing fresh grounds for government to improve future contract planning.
