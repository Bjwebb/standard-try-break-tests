# Extensions

Some times you need to publish information within your Open Contracting Data Standard releases and records which is not covered by the core schema.

Subject to the [conformance section](http://ocds.open-contracting.org/standard/r/1__0__0/en/key_concepts/conformance_and_extensions/) of the standard documentation, you can include additional fields within your OCDS files to meet your local needs.

To enable:

* Validation of this additional data;
* The emergence of common approaches to extending the standard;

the standard also supports the documentation of common extensions.

This directory holds agreed extensions to the standard. Whilst not currently part of the core standard, these extensions represent approved patterns for publishing common additional units of data. 

Over time we anticipate a library of extensions to develop to support the needs of different publishers. 

You can propose an extension in the [implementation-and-extensions](https://github.com/open-contracting/implementation-and-extensions/) repository.
