There are a number of use cases that demand specifying a location for delivery of an item.

Use case 1
==========

The Department of Health may wish to purchase 10 medical devices for 10 separate hospitals in Australia.

These items are all part of a single contracting process as the same supplier is expected to deliver all 10 units, but 
we wish to express the location of the seperate hospital to which the items are to be delivered.
