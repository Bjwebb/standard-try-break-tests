# Develop your own extension

The core OCDS schema provides a set of sections, building blocks and fields for describing a wide range of different contracting processes. 

Data publishers or users may have additional data that they could publish, or that they need. Instead of ignoring this data and leaving it unpublished, OCDS encourages publishers and users to collaborate on the creation of extensions to the standard.

This can result in two kinds of extension:

* **Core extensions** provide new sections, building blocks and/or fields that are likely to have widespread utility. A standard extension is likely to be useful in many different countries and contexts. 

* **Community extensions** document the fields used by a single publisher, application or locality. For example, a local extension may describe how to provide information required by a particular national level system, but where such an extension is unlikely to be useful in other countries or contexts. 

Both kinds of extension provide documentation and schema that can be used to produce and validate extended OCDS data. 

Core extensions are embedded directly within the OCDS reference documentation, and versioned along with the standard. This highlights to data publishers and users the optional extensions that are available. 

Links to externally hosted local extensions may be included in the OCDS reference documentation, drawing on the [extensions registry](https://github.com/open-contracting/extension_registry). 

## Extension template

You can find the [extension template](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard_extension_template) on GitHub. It contains guidance on creating an extension.
