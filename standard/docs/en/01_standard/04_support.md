## Community support

If you are planning to implement or use the OCDS Specification you may find the [public-ocds mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/webfoundation.org/forum/#!forum/public-ocds) to be a useful source of support.

Announcements about proposed updates to the specification, and periods for comment, will be made to the mailing list.

Developers, or those wishing to provide technical input on the standard, may wish to go straight to the [Github repository](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard).
