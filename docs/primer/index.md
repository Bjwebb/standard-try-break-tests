```{admonition} Objectives
:class: note

This Primer to the Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) will help you get started with publishing OCDS data. It exists to define core concepts for understanding the OCDS and direct you to the relevant sections of the documentation based on your needs.
```

In this Primer, you will find resources to help you answer these questions:

* [What is OCDS and why use it?](what)
* [How does the OCDS work?](how)
* [How is OCDS data published?](releases_and_records)
* [How can I implement the OCDS?](next)

Beyond the Primer, the OCDS provides detailed documentation to guide you in implementing the standard. It provides you with access to the [authoritative version](../schema/index) of the data standard, [guidance](../guidance/index) on data publication, and other relevant resources.

The OCDS also provides tools and detailed documentation to guide you in implementing the standard. The OCDS documentation includes several sections:

* [Guidance](../guidance/index): Step-by-step instructions on how to design and implement an OCDS publication, including practical examples
* [Reference](../schema/index): The OCDS data model (schemas, codelists and validation rules) as well as specific rules that need to be followed to publish OCDS data
* [Getting help](../support/index): How you can get Helpdesk support, tools that can help you use OCDS, and how you can participate in the OCDS community
* [Governance](../governance/index): Details about the stewardships, development, and revisions process for OCDS
* [History](../history/index): Information about the changes in each version of the OCDS
* [Data Review Tool](https://standard.open-contracting.org/review/): A tool to help check whether your data is following the OCDS correctly.
