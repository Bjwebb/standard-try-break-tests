"OCDS publishers are encouraged to use releases and records to publish data "
"in near real-time and to provide a change history. Tracking change over time"
" is important to users of contracting data because there can be many changes"

"attributes have changed can help users to understand the process, identify "
"inefficiencies, and spot red flags for corruption."
