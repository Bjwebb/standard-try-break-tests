Governments around the world spend an estimated [US$13 trillion](https://www.open-contracting.org/what-is-open-contracting/global-procurement-spend/) through contracts every year. Yet, contracting information is often unavailable for public scrutiny.

The Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) enables disclosure of data and documents at all stages of the contracting process by defining a common data model. It was created to support organizations to increase contracting transparency, and allow deeper analysis of contracting data by a wide range of users.

The OCDS is made up of several parts, designed to help you use OCDS effectively.
