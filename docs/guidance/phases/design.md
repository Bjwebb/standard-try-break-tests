# Design

This phase is about setting yourself up for success.

A first two steps are to understand your context and prepare your team. If you already intend to create or update an electronic government procurement (e-GP) system or open contracting data portal as part of your implementation, a third step is to ensure that it is designed to support your implementation.

## Understand your context

How does public contracting work in your jurisdiction? What does the law require to be made public? What are the opportunities or barriers to greater openness? Which stakeholders ought to be involved? What institutional and technical skills and experience do stakeholders have?

The answers to these questions will have an impact on the success of your implementation. You can find the answers by following, adapting, or commissioning a report based on our [methodology for open contracting scoping studies](https://www.open-contracting.org/resources/methodology-open-contracting-scoping-studies/).

## Prepare your team

The [Open Contracting Playbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qRb171Ps-CZdyk5fXlEyo-lxKaVbJtzIP7iyjbfUyU0/edit) is a collection of our non-technical advice for reforms in public contracting. You can read [Component 1: Set reform goals and secure buy-in](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qRb171Ps-CZdyk5fXlEyo-lxKaVbJtzIP7iyjbfUyU0/edit#heading=h.5fyh9snz6r8e), to learn how to set your goals, build your team, conduct user research, and define use cases. You can also read how to [develop a simple monitoring, evaluation and learning plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qRb171Ps-CZdyk5fXlEyo-lxKaVbJtzIP7iyjbfUyU0/edit#heading=h.pne882a3fj44), to learn how to track your progress.

In terms of technical advice, you can:

* Contact the [OCDS Helpdesk](../../support/index) to schedule an online introduction to OCDS for your technical team, in either English or Spanish.

## Align your e-GP system

If you will be creating or updating an <abbr title="electronic government procurement system">e-GP system</abbr> or open contracting data portal as part of your implementation, you can refer to our [Guide to Defining OCDS Functional Requirements for e-GP Systems](https://www.open-contracting.org/resources/guide-defining-open-contracting-data-standard-functional-requirements-electronic-government-procurement-systems/), which includes functional requirements and template clauses that you can adapt for your technical specifications or procurement documents (terms of reference, request for proposals, etc.).

The World Bank Group's [e-Procurement Toolkit](http://www.eprocurementtoolkit.org/) offers additional advice and template requirements for procuring e-GP systems, and its [Open Contracting Data Standard Implementation Methodology](http://www.eprocurementtoolkit.org/sites/default/files/2016-11/OCDS_Implemetation_Methodology_0.pdf#page=27) has guidance relevant to OCDS in e-GP systems from section 3.2.3 on page 27 onwards. *(Note: Its earlier sections are based on OCDS 1.0.0.)*
